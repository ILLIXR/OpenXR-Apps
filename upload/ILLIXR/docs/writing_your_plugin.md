# Writing your plugin

With this, you can extend ILLIXR for your own purposes. You can also replace any existing
functionality this way.

1.  We suggest making a subdirectory in the ILLIXR repo, but one could make it anywhere.

  - Add this directory to `plugins` in ILLIXR's root `Makefile`. The order in this list determines
   the order of initialization in the program. [`phonebook`][2], for example, is order-sensitive.

  - In your plugin directory, we suggest symlinking common (`ln -s ../common common`).

  - Create a `Makefile` with the following contents. See [Building ILLIXR][1] for more details and alternative setups.


        include common.mk

2.  You must decide if your plugin should inherit the standardized [`threadloop`][3] or
    [`plugin`][4].

  - If your plugin just needs to run one computation repeatedly, then your plugin class should
    extend [`threadloop`][3].

  - If you need custom concurrency (more complicated than a loop), triggered concurrency (by
    events fired in other plugins), or no concurrency then your plugin class should extend
    [`plugin`][4].

3.  Write a file called `plugin.cpp` with this body, replacing every instance of `plugin_name`:

        #include "common/phonebook.hpp"
        #include "common/plugin.hpp"
        #include "common/threadloop.hpp"

        using namespace ILLIXR;

        // Inherit from `plugin` if you don't need the threadloop
        class plugin_name : public threadloop {
        public:
            plugin_name(std::string name_, phonebook* pb_)
                : threadloop{name_, pb_}
                { }
            virtual void start() override { }
            virtual ~plugin_name() override { }
        };

        // This line makes the plugin importable by Spindle
        PLUGIN_MAIN(plugin_name);


4.  At this point, you should be able to go to the ILLIXR root and `make dbg`. If you edit a source
    file and then `make dbg`, it should trigger a rebuild of your plugin.

5.  This is all that is required to be a plugin which can be loaded by Spindle in the ILLIXR
    runtime. Reading and writing from Phonebook and Switchboard optional, but nearly every plugin
    does it. See `default_plugins.md` for more details.

    First, we can query the [`phonebook`][2] to get various services including [`switchboard`][5]. Then we
    query [`switchboard`][5] for event-streams (topics). We will read `topic1`, write to `topic2`, and
    schedule computation on `topic 3`. See the API documentation for `phonebook` and `switchboard`
    for more details.


        #include "common/phonebook.hpp"
        #include "common/plugin.hpp"
        #include "common/threadloop.hpp"

        /* When datatypes have to be common across plugins
          (e.g. a phonebook service or switchboard topic),
           they are defined in this header,
           which is accessible to all plugins. */
        #include "common/data_format.hpp"

        class plugin_name : public threadloop {
        public:
            /*
                After the constructor, C++ permits a list of member-constructors.
                We use uniform initialization (curly-braces) [1] instead of parens to avoid ambiguity [2].
